# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

This project demonstrates the implementation and performance measurement of various sorting and searching algorithms in C. The algorithms covered include Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Sequential Search, and Binary Search. It generates a random array, applies the algorithms, and measures their execution time and number of comparisons.

## Functions

### Sorting Algorithms
- insertionSort
- selectionSort
- mergeSort
- quickSort
  
### Searching Algorithms
- buscaSequencial
- buscaBinaria

## Performance Measurement

The execution time and number of comparisons for each algorithm are measured using the clock() function. The results are printed to the console after each algorithm is executed.

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
make
```
